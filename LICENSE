## Quick checklist before publishing
- [ ] Source (`prompt_game.py`) committed and pushed.
- [ ] README and LICENSE present.
- [ ] `dist/prompt_game.exe` built and uploaded to Releases.
- [ ] Add SHA256 checksum to release notes.
- [ ] Consider zipping the exe for distribution.

If you want, I can:
- generate the exact `README.md` and `.gitignore` file content for you to copy, or
- give the exact commands tailored to your GitHub username and repo name — tell me your `github-username` and desired `repo-name` and I’ll produce the commands. Which do you prefer?
